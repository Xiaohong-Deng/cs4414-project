# 13-Mar
* Create a task to listen on socket 23158 -> takes a Chan to put Events on (maybe just pure JSON messages for now?)
* Peers will communicate via JSON (goraft uses protocol buffers)
* server_loop will grab from the event Port
* Chan is now clonable => if doesnt' work, may need to upgrade compiler (11-Mar release)
