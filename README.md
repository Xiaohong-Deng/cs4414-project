An implementation of the [Raft distributed consensus algorithm](https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf) in Rust.

## Status

I have begun work on it for the Spring 2014 session of the [cs4414 Operating Systems course](http://rust-class.org/) being taught in Rust.  It will be my semester class project.  Since it is for the course, I have to keep the code private until the course is finished, at which point it will be open sourced and posted here in April or May 2014.
